Hello coder,

You have intercepted ten sets of confidential documents from a secret hacking group's Discord. Some of the documents are message logs, others are source code, and a few contain only some cryptic numbers or encrypted text.

Each folder contains one set of documents. For example, folder A contains two files, A.txt and E-hint.zip. A.txt is the problem statement and contains a problem for you to solve. After you find the answer for A.txt, you can use it to open the password-protected E-hint.zip. E-hint.zip contains a hint for problem E. If you have trouble opening the hint zips, message us on Zoom.

Later problems may require hints from earlier problems.

You can view the rules and scoreboard at using this link:

If you have any questions, message us on Zoom.

Good luck and have fun.
