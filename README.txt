Hello coder,

You have intercepted ten sets of confidential documents from a secret hacking group's Discord. Some of the documents are message logs, others are source code, and a few contain only some cryptic numbers or encrypted text.

Rules:

1. Teams of 2 people

2. Everything is allowed unless otherwise stated

3. Each problem folder contains two files. For example, folder A contains A.txt and E-hint.zip. A.txt is the problem statement and contains a problem for you to solve. After you solve problem A, you can use the answer to open the password-protected E-hint.zip, which contains a hint for problem E. If you have trouble opening the hint zips, message Anthony on Zoom. Later problems may require hints from earlier problems.

4. After finishing a problem, message Anthony WITH THE ANSWER and I will update the scoreboard. This is optional, if you don't want to share your current rank.

5. Each problem is worth 10 points, except for J which worth 30 points. Highest score wins

You can view the latest rules and scoreboard using this link:

If you have any questions, message Anthony on Zoom.

Good luck and have fun.
